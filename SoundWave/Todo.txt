Add more testcases
Add state for the phase to be able to support frequency modulation

Continue with the ConnectionStyle (or simpiyfy it)
The calculation in SSoundBoxFrequency is wrong:
fFrequency + (fFrequencyFMSpan * valueFMFrequency.Value ?? 0)) + (valueFMFrequency.PhaseChange ?? 0)
valueFMFrequency.Value is allways null
Probably move the FrequencyFMSpan from the SoundBoxFrequency constructor to the FrequencyFMInput()
Add more gui to be able to test it more.
Add protection for infinity loops (feedback loops)
Add instruments with timbre settings connected to key and speed and sustain aso.
